In a non-Agile project the Product Owner is usually the Project manager who takes the risks for the team and directs where the product should go. He also manages the manager who have teams of their own. Product owners are needed in Agille Methodology because there it is a much more itereative process that involves communicating the product specifications with the customer's expectation.

The Scrum Master handles all tasks related to the Jira and tooling. This includes facilitating sprints, holding meetings, standups and other infrastructurial work. The Product Owner Sets direction for the team and handles release management and stakeholder management which involves talking to customers.

There are three types of meetings in a sprint. Here they are in the corresponding order:
Sprint Planning Meeting - Determine what to complete during sprint. Determine story points and assign stories to team.
Daily Standup Meeting: Short meeting that happen every workday of the sprint. Usually only 10 minutes long.
Sprint Retrospective - Occurs at the end of the sprint. Discuss complete work and move incomplete work to backlog.
